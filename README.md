# ScrolleX
A customizable scroll bar for iOS 13+16, all devices. Add cool shadows, custom border colors and corner radius, and set custom widths before and after interacting with the scroll bars.  Works on both verticle and horizontal scroll bars.  Apple by design kind of hid this feature so I like to make mine extra big and wide.  :==D

A compiled version is available in my repo https://i0s-tweak3r-betas.yourepo.com

(code is on Master fork... uploaded a weird way and cant figure out how to merge the two, it wont let me do a pull fast forward or merge.)
