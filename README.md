# ScrolleX
A customizable scroll bar for iOS 13+14, all devices. Add cool shadows and set custom widths before and after interacting with them.

A compiled version is available in my repo https://i0s-tweak3r-betas.yourepo.com

(code is on Master fork... uploaded a weird way and cant figure out how to merge the two, it wont let me do a pull or merge.)
